# ICARDA Genebank Population Genetics Data Analysis

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Population Genetics Data Analysis at the ICARDA Genebank. This repository is dedicated to providing resources, scripts, and documentation for various analyses in population genetics, including Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), Linkage Disequilibrium (LD), Genotype-by-Environment (GxE) interactions, Environment-Wide Association Studies (EWAS), and other.

## About ICARDA Genebank

The ICARDA Genebank plays a critical role in conserving genetic resources and supporting breeding programs aimed at improving agricultural productivity and sustainability in arid and semi-arid regions. Our work includes advanced population genetics analyses to support crop improvement and genetic conservation.

**This repository is part of Dr. Zakaria Kehelâ€™s research lab. Dr. Zakaria Kehel is a genetic resources scientist.**
